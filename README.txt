To Test Directory Check:

1. Open "Testing Grounds.py" with IDLE
2. Run Program

Notes:

1. If you would like to make the program think its the first time it was run, change the value inside "State.txt" to 0 and save.
2. There are currently no checks for if an entered directory actually exists.  Entering a directory that does not exist on the computer will result in a run-stop error.
